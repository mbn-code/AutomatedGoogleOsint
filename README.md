# GoogleScienceSearch

GoogleScienceSearch is a Python script that utilizes the `googlesearch` module to perform web searches automatically based on your input query. This tool is particularly useful for gathering information about individuals using their names or usernames. The script keeps track of search results history, allowing you to store and retrieve results until you initiate a new scan. This feature facilitates easy copying and pasting of valuable information.
